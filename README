# epoll-rust

WARNING: This repository is highly experimental. Examples, and interfaces here are for exploration and learning only — do not use in production.

epoll-rust is a small collection of experiments and examples demonstrating low-level epoll-based I/O patterns in Rust. The code shows how to create and use epoll instances, register file descriptors, and perform edge/level-triggered waits. The project explores safe and unsafe Rust boundaries, minimal wrappers over libc/nix, and simple event loops for learning purposes.

Important notes
- Linux only (epoll is a Linux-specific kernel API).
- Experimental: interfaces and safety guarantees are not finalized.
- Expect breaking changes and incomplete error handling.
- You should be familiar with non-blocking sockets/FDs and Rust's ownership/unsafe rules before digging in.

Quick start
1. Install Rust (stable channel).
2. Build:
    ```
    cargo build
    ```
